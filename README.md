BrowserDB
=========

A client database that uses IndexedDB, WebSQL, or localStorage depending on browser support.

Notice
------
This is a fork of [localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage) by Mozilla,
however without all of the underlining kerfuffle such as AMD or bower.

It uses [commonjs](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1) pattern for modules and [browserify](http://browserify.org/) to package them for the browser.

If that doesn't suit your needs go with the orginal or just use the compiled version.
